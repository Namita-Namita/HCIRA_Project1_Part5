Human-Centered Input Recognition Algorithms - Project 2

- Namita Namita (48479313)

##System:-
In this continuation of Project 1, we are gathering sample data from three input methods (mouse, stylus, and non-stylus) to compare the recognition accuracy across all these modes. We are using GHOST Heatmap to analyze the variation in the gestures drawn for all input modes we used.

##Submission files:-
Project2.zip, readme.txt, HCIRA-Proj2-demo_Group09.pptx.

Project2.zip contains all the following:
1. Source code folder
2. Dataset folder with user data for all input modes
3. Consent forms
4. Logfiles (names of log files explain the input modality)
5. Feature data (names of Feature data files explain the input modality)
6. Heatmaps (names of heatmap files explain the input modality)
7. Demo Video
8. Offline Test Graph

###Steps to install and execute the project:-
- Unzip the Project2.zip file.
- Open the Project2_source_code folder in VS code by navigating to the editor.
- Click the UiFrame.java file to open the source code in the editor.
- Run the UiFrame.java file by clicking the run button in the right corner of the VS Code.
- The canvas along with the "Clear" button as expected.
- Try out gestures by dragging the mouse in the canvas, and once the gesture is drawn recognition results with the score and time will be shown on top of the window.
- Click the CollectionUI.java file to open the source code in the editor.
- Run the CollectionUI.java file by clicking the run button in the right corner of the VS Code.
- The canvas along with the buttons and instructions will appear as expected.
- Try out gestures by dragging the mouse in the canvas, and clicking the "submit" or "Draw Again" button to submit the sample or retry the gesture.
- Click the TrainandTest.java file to open the source code in the editor.
- Run the TrainandTest.java file by clicking the run button in the right corner of the VS Code.
- The log file with the name HCIRA-Proj1-logfile.csv will be created in the same project folder.


###Functionality implemented:-
- In Project 2, we are continuing Project 1 where we are gathering sample data from three input methods (mouse, stylus, and non-stylus) to compare the recognition accuracy across all these modes. 
- We are also using GHOST Heatmap to analyze the variation in the gestures drawn for all input modes we used.


###Goals achieved:
a) update your GUI canvas code;
- The code for sample data collection from users is transferred and updated in a new file "CollectionUI.java" to enhance User interface as well as to follow folder structure need for GHOST heatmap analysis.


b) recruit 6 people to provide gesture samples for your project; 
- 6 people are recruited to collect samples of all 16 gestures (10 samples each) for all three modes if input.
- A consent form was presented to them to read and sign before the activity.
